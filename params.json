{"name":"Grayskull","body":"Grayskull\r\n=========\r\n\r\nGrayskull is a Ruby library for validating data files against custom schema. It currently validates YAML and JSON files. It can be used as a library in your \r\nruby code and also comes with a command line tool.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngem install grayskull\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n###Library###\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'grayskull'\r\nvalidator = Grayskull::Validator.new(file,schema)\r\nresults = validator.validate\r\n```\r\n\r\nGrayskulls `validate` function will return one of the following Hashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccess:\r\n\r\n```ruby\t\r\n{\r\n    \"result\":true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\t\r\nFailure:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n{\r\n    \"result\":false,\r\n    \"errors\":errors #Array of error messages\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\t\r\n###Command Line###\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngrayskull validate path/to/file path/to/schema\r\n```\r\n\t\r\n###Schema Files###\r\n\r\nSchema files should be in the following format:\r\n\r\nYAML:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nsections:\r\n  - name: section1 #section name\r\n    required: yes\r\n    type: Array #Valid ruby type or a custom type as defined in types.\r\n    ok_empty: yes\r\n    accepts: #list of accepted types\r\n      - custom_type1\r\n      - custom_type2\r\ntypes:\r\n  custom_type1:\r\n    type: Hash #Valid ruby type or a custom type as defined in types.\r\n    ok_empty: yes\r\n    accepts:\r\n      - String #list of accepted types\r\n  custom_type2:\r\n    type: Array\r\n    ok_empty: yes\r\n    accepts:\r\n      - Array\r\n```\r\n \r\nJSON\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\"sections\":[\r\n               {\r\n\t\t    \"name\": \"section_name\",\r\n\t\t    \"required\": true,\r\n\t\t    \"type\": \"Array\", \r\n\t\t    \"ok_empty\": true,\r\n\t\t    \"accepts\":[ \r\n\t\t\t\t\"custom_type1\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\"String\"\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t}\r\n    \t],\r\n\"types\":{\r\n    \"custom_type1\":{\r\n        \"type\":\"Hash\",\r\n    \t\"ok_empty\":true,\r\n    \t\"accepts\":[ \r\n    \t\t\"Hash\"\r\n    \t    ]\r\n\t},\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\t\r\nAs all files are converted to native ruby formats you can mix json files with yaml schemas and vice versa.\r\n\r\nComing Soon\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* More formats\r\n* Unit Tests\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis is an extraction of the validation code from my first gem skeletor. I'm still pretty new to ruby so I'd be really grateful for any constructive feedback, input, suggestions etc. As usual, if anybody wants to\r\ncontribute feel free, just check out the guidelines below.\r\n\r\nContributing to Grayskull\r\n------------------------\r\n \r\n* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet\r\n* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it\r\n* Fork the project\r\n* Start a feature/bugfix branch\r\n* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution\r\n* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.\r\n* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Will McKenzie (OiNutter)\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
